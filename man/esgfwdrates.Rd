\usage{
esgfwdrates(
  in.maturities,
  in.zerorates,
  n,
  horizon,
  out.frequency = c("annual", "semi-annual", "quarterly", "monthly", "weekly", "daily"),
  method = c("fmm", "periodic", "natural", "monoH.FC", "hyman"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{in.maturities}{input maturities}

\item{in.zerorates}{input zero rates}

\item{n}{number of independent observations}

\item{horizon}{horizon of projection}

\item{out.frequency}{either "annual", "semi-annual", "quarterly", "monthly", 
"weekly", or "daily" (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/12, 1/52, 1/252)}

\item{method}{specifies the type of spline to be used for interpolation. Possible values are "fmm", "natural", "periodic", "monoH.FC" and "hyman".
See \code{\link{spline}}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters provided to \code{\link{splinefun}}}
}
\description{
This function provides instantaneous forward rates. They can be used 
in no-arbitrage short rate models, to fit the yield curve exactly.
