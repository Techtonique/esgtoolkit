\title{Estimation of discounted asset prices}
\usage{
esgmcprices(r, X, maturity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Interest rate time series or constant value}

\item{X}{Asset price time series or constant value}

\item{maturity}{Optional maturity date for the calculation}
}
\value{
A time series object containing the discounted asset prices, or a single value
        if a maturity date is specified
}
\description{
Calculates the discounted asset prices using simulated interest rates and asset values.
}
\details{
The function takes interest rates and asset prices as inputs and calculates the discounted
asset prices. It handles both time series and constant values for both inputs.

If a maturity date is specified, the function returns the discounted price at that maturity.
Otherwise, it returns the time series of discounted prices averaged across all scenarios.
}
\examples{
# Using constant values
r <- 0.05
X <- 100
price <- esgmcprices(r, X)

# Using time series
r_ts <- ts(matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10), start = 0, deltat = 0.1)
X_ts <- ts(matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10), start = 0, deltat = 0.1)
prices_ts <- esgmcprices(r_ts, X_ts)

# With maturity
price_at_maturity <- esgmcprices(r_ts, X_ts, maturity = 1)

}
