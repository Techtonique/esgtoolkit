"weekly", or "daily" (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/12, 1/52, 1/252).}

\item{method}{either classic monte carlo, antithetic variates, moment matching, 
hybrid antithetic variates + moment matching, "TAG" (see the 4th reference for 
the latter. Options: "classic", "antithetic", 
                                 "mm", "hybridantimm", "TAG".}

\item{par}{
A d*(d-1)/2 vector of pair-copula parameters.}

\item{par2}{
A d*(d-1)/2 vector of second parameters for pair-copula families with two 
parameters (t, BB1, BB6, BB7, BB8; no default).}

\item{RVM}{An \code{\link[VineCopula]{RVineMatrix}} object containing the 
information of the R-vine copula model. Optionally, a length-N list 
of \code{VineCopula::RVineMatrix} objects sharing the same structure, but 
possibly different family/parameter can be supplied. Must be not NULL for 
type == "RVine", not used otherwise. See also VineCopula::RVineMatrix.}

\item{type}{type of vine model: "CVine", "DVine" or "RVine"}

\item{start}{the time of the first observation. Either a single number or a vector of two numbers (the second of which is an integer), which specify a natural time unit and a (1-based) number of samples into the time unit. See `?ts`.}

\item{seed}{reproducibility seed}
}
\value{
If \code{family} and \code{par} are not provided, a univariate time 
series object with simulated gaussian shocks for one risk factor. Otherwise, 
a list of time series objects, containing gaussian shocks for each risk factor.
}
\description{
This function makes simulations of correlated or dependent gaussian shocks for risk factors.
}
\details{
The function shall be used along with \code{\link{simdiff}}, in order to embed  
correlated or dependent random gaussian shocks into simulated diffusions. 
\code{\link{esgplotshocks}} can help in visualizing the type of dependence 
between the shocks.
